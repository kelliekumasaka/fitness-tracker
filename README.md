## About
This website allows you to track your workout progress and put that data into a `MongoDB` database, so you can track your progress over the past week and see what you've done most recently.

## Description

On page load, you are shown a screen that displays your last workout with information about it, including date, total duration, etc.

When you want to add a new workout or continue a workout, you are shown this page that will allow you to add one or more exercises to the workout. Depending on whether you choose `Resistance` or `Cardio`, the inputs will be different.

After clicking `Complete` or `Add Exercise`, then there is a success alert that triggers and, if you clicked on `Complete` then you will be redirected to the fitness tracker home page, with your new workout information.

If you click on the dashboard link at the top, you are taken to a page with graphs that track how many pounds you have lifted for your resistance workouts and a line graph tracking the length of time that you've exercised over the past week.
